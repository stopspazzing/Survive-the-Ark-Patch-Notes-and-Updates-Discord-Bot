# Survive the Ark Patch Notes and Updates Discord Bot
Ark Game Discord Bot used to monitor updates and patch notes and display them in discord channels. Using async, made 3 loops in a discord bot to handle callbacks and the 2 timers. This needs an api code for discord at a minimum. Watchings youtube, twitter, and SurviveTheArk website patch notes page for changes in code to list patch notes and any updates they post. 

*The license is GNU GPLv3 BUT uses Common Clause license as the primary, so you may not sell it but can change it how you like. I hope this helps others out with using multiple async loops in a single project as I had a hard time finding anyone who used it this way.*


## Requirements
1. Python 3.7.x or greater
2. API code from Discord Bot page
3. If using twitter portion, twitter api code
